## Introduction
After recently attending Morpheus events and answering questions to the community, here are my TOP 10 points that I’m excited about Morpheus and I think you should be too. 

## _For the Investors_
### 1.	The Techno Capital Machine 
It is more than just a quirky name; it's a [fundraising game-changer](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Capital%20Providers%2C%20MOR20%2C%20TCM/Techno%20Capital%20Machine%20(TCM).md#tcm-smart-contracts-for-fair-launch). Investors start earning MOR daily by depositing ETH as stETH into the Morpheus contract on Ethereum's main chain. The best part? Users can withdraw their stETH anytime and claim their earned MOR: your keys, your coins. Over 1% of LIDO's stETH is already in the Morpheus contract.

### 2.	Ever-growing Liquidity
Unlike traditional liquidity providers, who can withdraw their funds to support a coin's liquidity at any time, in Morpheus, [stETH yields from the community are directed to Uniswap's liquidity pool](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Capital%20Providers%2C%20MOR20%2C%20TCM/Phased%20AMM%20Deployment%20and%20Fair%20Price%20Discovery.md), which only increases daily. This growth is a key metric for whale investors.

### 3.	Real Life Utility for MOR 
Holders can access [free AI compute daily](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Compute%20Providers/Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md#accessrate) based on their token ownership percentage. This means owning MOR grants direct access to the network's computing power without recurring fees.

### 4.	And Also Staking MOR 
Instead of navigating complex quadratic voting processes, DAOs, or politically swayed community funds, MOR holders vote directly by [staking their tokens](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Capital%20Providers%2C%20MOR20%2C%20TCM/Techno%20Capital%20Machine%20(TCM).md#extending-the-morpheus-tcm-using-the-mor-token) with new projects they support and receiving rewards for their efforts. 

## _For the Devs_
### 5.	Ample Funds to Pay the Builders on Day One 
[Contributors providing computing power or models](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Morpheus%20Builders%20Guide.mdd) are compensated immediately upon launch, eliminating the need for a lengthy marketing grind and user acquisition. The stETH depositors have already bootstrapped the ecosystem. 

### 6.	The Morpheus App Store for AI 
Morpheus acts as a marketplace for compute providers and AI code. Built on principles of free market competition and decentralization, it rewards contributors directly without intermediaries or centralized control. With a free market approach, the best models and compute providers acquire the most consumers. 

### 7.	Scales Like an Ecosystem, but Runs Like Contract
Morpheus's [decentralized contracts govern](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Compute%20Providers/Morpheus%20Lumerin%20Model.md#ecosystem-model) and control [ecosystem funds](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Capital%20Providers%2C%20MOR20%2C%20TCM/The%20Morpheus%20Asset%20Integration%20Framework.md) efficiently with minimal overhead. While not as complex as L1 or L2 solutions to build from scratch and maintain, its marketplace model enables exponential scalability. Only recently has blockchain development technology matured to the point where this kind of project is possible. 

## _For the Entrepeneurs_
### 8.	Community Building Rewards 
Morpheus incentivizes those who further the adoption of Morpheus. Referrers who [help others deposit stETH also receive rewards](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC08.md#2-capital-front-ends), decentralizing community leadership and fostering a global network of contributors while helping to increase funds for operations. 

### 9.	Critical Real World Need and Market Fit
Decentralized AI addresses urgent privacy concerns and mistrust in big tech. Morpheus leverages blockchain advancements to deploy AI on a decentralized network, providing an uncensored and privacy-centric alternative to centralized platforms.

### 10. MOR20 Standard
Morpheus is a set of contracts that include the fundraising mechanism (The Techno Capital Machine) used to help bootstrap an AI marketplace. These contracts are open-sourced and now battle-tested in a real-world environment, securing over $400,000,000 USD worth of stETH. They are being packaged today as part of the [MOR20 standard](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Capital%20Providers%2C%20MOR20%2C%20TCM/Techno%20Capital%20Machine%20(TCM).md#automated-recurring-revenue--rewards-arr-generalizing-the-tcm-model---mor20-token-standard), which allows others to use this model to help fund their projects.
