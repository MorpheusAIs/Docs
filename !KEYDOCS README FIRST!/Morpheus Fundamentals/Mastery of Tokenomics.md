# Deep dive into Morpheus Tokenomics

## Introduction:
Tokenomics serves as the backbone of Web3 projects, shaping their dynamics and benefits. A journey through the evolution of tokenomics, starting with Bitcoin, reveals its pivotal role.  

Tokenomics models over time:
- **Bitcoin Era:** Bitcoin introduced decentralized currency, emphasizing scarcity and value through capped supply and Proof-of-Work.
- **Ethereum and Smart Contracts:** Ethereum expanded tokenomics, enabling programmable assets through smart contracts, leading to the tokenization trend.
- **DeFi and Governance Tokens:** Governance tokens in DeFi showcased how tokens empower users in protocol decision-making.
- **NFTs:** The rise of NFTs demonstrated the versatility of tokens beyond financial applications.
- **RWA (Real World Assets)**: Variants of tokenomics partially or fully dependent on real-world assets.

## What’s the Problem?
The significance of effective tokenomics becomes apparent when exploring the challenges posed by flawed models, impacting user engagement, project business model and long term sustainability.

Attracting and retaining users becomes a challenge because poor tokenomics discourages users from active engagement by failing to provide clear benefits or incentives and a lack of utility or tangible value diminishes project appeal. Which also leads to unreasonably high marketing costs.

Tokenomic flaws can result in economic misalignments, leading to unfair distribution of value and impacting the overall health of the ecosystem. Under such conditions, the business model stops working, jeopardizing the sustainability of the project and, as a result, endless pivoting or bankruptcy.

## Is there a way out?
Morpheus addresses these challenges through a comprehensive solution, intertwining various components that leverage MOR tokens effectively, thereby creating both internal and external demand. 

Morpheus tokenomics incorporates elements from all models: 
1. Inspired by Bitcoin, it incorporates an emission cap of 42 000 000 with gradual token release starting from 14,400 MOR per day and then declining by 2.468994701 MOR each day, until the reward reaches 0 on day 5,833 (about 16 years). This schedule is aligned with project growth and prevents excessive supply.
2. From Ethereum, it ensures transparency and strict adherence to set conditions through smart contracts.
3. Taking cues from DeFi, tokenomics allows the use of MOR tokens as an investment tool, providing rewards for contributions to project development.
4. Drawing from NFTs and RWAs, it enables MOR holders to claim a portion of network computational power daily and engage (including rewards) with other player categories for various actions.

## Techno Capital Machine Tokenomics Engine
Morpheus introduces a novel token distribution mechanism called the Techno Capital Machine (TCM). It distributes tokens fairly while accruing value that is used to provision Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL).

Here is an overview of the TCM mechanism:
1. Capital contributors deposit stETH (Lido Staked Ethereum) that generates yield and are rewarded pro rata in the native token, MOR.
2. The Morpheus contract uses 50% of the yield to buy MOR token from AMM and pairs it with the remaining 50% of the yield to provide liquidity.
3. Holders of MOR tokens have access to Morpheus' utility.  

**The TCM model has a number of advantages over other bootstrapping and token launch models:**
- Users do not contribute capital/principal directly, but yield.
- There is no risk of impermanent loss.
- Yield creates continuous demand for the native token.
- Protocol-Owned Liquidity grows over time.
- The model is fair, chain-agnostic, and scalable.

## Incentives for ecosystem players 
There are four categories of ecosystem players in Morpheus, each of which are allocated 24% of MOR emissions:
- Capital Providers.
- Compute Providers.
- Code Providers.
- Community Builders.

**Capital Providers** participate in the Techno Capital Machine, providing yield-bearing capital which drives MOR's Protocol-Owned Liquidity.

**Code Providers** contribute to the evolution of Morpheus' code and the creation of Smart Agents. Upon contributing, Code providers request "weights" – arbitrary units of work which determine how MOR emissions are distributed among participants in this category.

**Compute Providers** produce the primary resource for the network – compute.

**Community Providers/Builders** enable adoption of Morpheus primarily through the creation of frontends.

## Special ingredients 
Thanks to a token utility first approach, available upon holding, a significant portion of tokens will stay in wallets with no movements, increasing in value with the influx of new users. This, in turn, leads to the growth of network effects.

Long-term sustainability in tokenomics is further ensured through a fair launch, avoiding sell pressure from VCs, private investors, or those who acquired tokens through private allocations or pre-mining.

MOR burn which works similar to the burn function in Ethereum is another mechanic that ensures MOR scarcity over time.

And that's not all, there is also the icing on the cake, in the form of a protection fund, which receives 4% of all emissions and is designed to act as a stabilizer of tokenomics in case of unforeseen events.

## Conclusions
Morpheus’ tokenomics presents a holistic framework, avoiding pitfalls and built with utility in mind. By incentivizing key contributors, their interactions and maintaining fair market dynamics, it establishes Morpheus as a sustainable innovator in the decentralized realm. Openness, clarity and a fair approach are factors that will naturally attract more and more new users.
