## Protocol-Owned Liquidity (PoL)
- PoL is liquidity owned and controlled by the protocol, not individual LPs.
- Ensures long-term sustainability and independence of the protocol.
- **PoL Creation:**
  - 33.3% of yield from Capital Providers is used to buy back MOR and pair with wETH for PoL.
  - 33.3% of yield is burned ([burn address](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x092baadb7def4c3981454dd9c0a0d7ff07bcfc86?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)).
  - 33.3% is locked for Epoch 2 tail emissions until 2040.
