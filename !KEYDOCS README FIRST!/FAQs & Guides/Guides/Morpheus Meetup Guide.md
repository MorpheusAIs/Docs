# Morpheus Meetup Guide
## Abstract:
Organizing a crypto meetup can be an exciting opportunity to connect with like-minded people, share knowledge and insights, exchange ideas and foster community engagement. Whether you're a seasoned organizer or new to event planning, this guide will provide you with best practices to ensure your Morpheus meetup is a success.

## Meetup Formats:
### Casual Meetup at a Bar or Cafe:
An informal gathering held at a local bar, cafe, or restaurant where attendees can mingle, network, and discuss crypto-related topics in a relaxed setting. Typical duration is 2-3 hours, allowing attendees to drop in and out as they please. Open discussions, lightning talks, or informal presentations. Consider incorporating networking activities to facilitate connections.
### Interactive Workshop at a Coworking Space:
A hands-on workshop hosted at a coworking space or community center, focusing on specific topics or skill-building exercises related to Morpheus (how to run and use node Morpheus node, for example).   
Typical duration is 2-4 hours, providing ample time for interactive sessions and group activities. You could also prepare tutorials and make a mini-hackathon where attendees can learn new concepts, collaborate on projects, and gain practical experience.
### Panel Discussion and Networking:
A moderated panel discussion featuring industry (DeAI / AI / Web3) experts, followed by networking opportunities for attendees to connect with panelists and fellow enthusiasts.  
Typical duration is 2-3 hours, with time allocated for both the panel and networking sessions. It’s important to cover trending topics or relevant narratives, followed by Q&A sessions and informal networking over refreshments.
### Community Roundtable and Knowledge Exchange:
A collaborative forum where community members come together to share insights, discuss challenges, and brainstorm solutions related to DeAI / AI / Morpheus related topics, regulation, or industry trends.   
Typical duration is 2-3 hours, with a mix of structured discussion sessions and open-floor exchanges. You can break out groups for deeper dives into niche areas, and facilitated knowledge-sharing sessions.
### Project Showcase and Demo Day (at the later stages of Morpheus development):
A showcase event highlighting innovative solutions, projects, tools, smart agents or initiatives within the Morpheus ecosystem. Attendees have the opportunity to demo their projects and receive feedback from the community.  
Typical duration is 3-4 hours, allowing each presenter sufficient time to showcase their work and engage with the audience. Consider incorporating a voting mechanism or audience choice awards for standout projects.  


> [!Note] 
> Regardless of the format chosen, emphasize that the meetup is intended to be an inclusive and engaging gathering, not a formal half-day conference. Encourage attendees to participate actively and contribute to the community-driven atmosphere.

## Preparation:
1) **Set format.** Define the format that fits the best to your audience. Is it an educational, networking-focused meetup, or a mix of both? 
2) **Select a Venue.** Choose a venue that accommodates your expected attendance and offers necessary amenities like seating, AV equipment, and internet access. Important: Consider factors such as accessibility and proximity to public transportation. 
3) **Set the Date and Time.** Schedule your meetup well in advance and consider factors like the availability of key speakers, holidays, and competing events.
4) **Promotion.** Create compelling event descriptions and visuals (you can for help Morpheus community) and utilize various channels to promote your meetup, including social media (incl. Morpheus socials), community forums, partners, local media. Encourage attendees to RSVP to gauge interest and plan accordingly. 
5) **Realization plan.** Think through all the details in advance, such as location signage, potential attendee questions, an adequate amount of refreshments, and also create a budget.

> [!Tip]
> - a good solution may be to hold the meetup as part of a larger event or conference;
> - partner with experienced organizers or community members to gain insights and support in planning and executing your meetup;
> - if the meetup lasts 3-4 hours, it is important to schedule a break;
> - plan enough time before the event for registration and after it for networking, regardless of the format;
> - use multiple platforms for RSVP or those that are commonly used in your region;
> - you can be a speaker yourself, or invite someone from open source contributors, for example David Johnston (smartagents in Discord).

## During the Meetup:
1) **Welcome and Introduction.** Start your meetup with a warm welcome and brief introduction to the agenda. Set the tone for an inclusive and engaging event.
2) **Engage Attendees.** Encourage active participation through Q&A sessions, networking activities, and group discussions. Create opportunities for attendees to share their experiences and insights.
3) **Content Delivery.** If featuring speakers or presentations, ensure they deliver valuable content that aligns with the meetup's theme. Keep presentations concise and engaging to maintain attendees' interest.
4) **Facilitate Networking.** Allocate time for attendees to network and exchange ideas. Consider icebreaker activities or group exercises to facilitate connections among participants.
   
> [!TIP]
> - one separate presentation should not exceed 15-20 minutes, as participants tend to  lose focus beyond this time;
> - it is important to mix and alternate different activity formats to maintain the dynamics of the meetup;
> - act as the moderator of the meetup and add your comments to keep the conversation engaging;
> - manage the time effectively; agree with the speakers on a signal to indicate when their speaking time is approaching its end;
> - it's a good idea to allocate a small prize fund for additional motivation for participants;
> - take plenty of photos, if possible, consider inviting a professional photographer;
> - it's better to serve refreshments after the meetup to keep the audience engaged until the end of the event; water should be served before the meetup.
  
## Post-Meetup:
1) **Collect Feedback.** Gather feedback from attendees to evaluate the success of your meetup and identify areas for improvement. Use surveys or informal discussions to solicit input.
2) **Follow-Up.** Maintain communication with attendees post-event by sharing resources, presentation materials, presentation recordings or upcoming opportunities. Express gratitude for their participation and encourage continued engagement.
3) **Reflect and Iterate.** Reflect on your meetup experience and identify lessons learned for future events. Continuously iterate and refine your approach based on feedback and evolving community needs.

## Tips for Novice Organizers:
1) **Start Small.** If you're new to organizing meetups, consider starting with smaller, more intimate gatherings before scaling up.

2) **Leverage Resources.** Utilize online resources, templates, and tools available for event planning, promotion, and logistics management.

3) **Be Flexible.** Adapt to unforeseen challenges or changes in circumstances gracefully. Maintain open communication with attendees and stakeholders throughout the process.

# Requirements for proof of the meetup and rewards:
1) Meetups can only be organized in cities specified in the appendix (last page), with no more than one per month.
2) All expenses are the responsibility of the organizer, which may be reimbursed as Full Time Equivalent according to actual [implied value of weight](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md). All expenses must be documented and confirmed.
3) A report on the meetup must be published on GitHub along with evidence of its usefulness, which may include:  
   a) photo and video documentation;  
   b) discussion notes;  
   c) speaker feedback forms;  
   d) networking tracker;  
   e) project demos and feedback;  
   f) social media mentions and engagement;  
   g) attendance and participation metrics;  
   h) testimonials and quotes.
4) The number of hours worked is not as important as the value produced by the work. If no value is created, no weights are credited.
5) Before organizing the meetup, familiarize yourself with the Code Contributor Best Practices and post in the “Issues” section about the need for a Morpheus Meetup in your city.
6) The expected number of rewarded weights is 1 to 4. 1 weight per 1 hour of the meetup and the resulting report, data, notes, analysis, on boarding of Smart Agent developers.
7) This is a one time reward for each city. Meetups should be community led after the first meetup because it generates value for them. Hopefully the first meeting sparks an interest by local Code Contributors, Compute Providers, Capital Providers and Front End builders to meetup on a regular basis.

**To be clear anyone can hold a Morpheus Meetup. No permission is required. There is no team. The community drives this project in a permissionless manner.**
