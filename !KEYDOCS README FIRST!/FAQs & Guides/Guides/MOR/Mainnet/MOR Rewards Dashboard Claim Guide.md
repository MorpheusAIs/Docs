## Preparation
1. As the claim transaction is initiated on the Ethereum mainnet and the MOR token is issued on the Arbitrum mainnet, users need to have both chains added to their wallets. The simplest way to do this is via the [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/42161) service. Visit the website, connect your wallet, and click on **"Add to Metamask."**

2. You will also need to have enough ETH on both the Ethereum and Arbitrum chains to pay transaction fees.

3. Common ways to get ETH on Arbitrum include bridging from another chain or withdrawing from a CEX.

4. It's advisable to have a wallet address on the Arbitrum chain prepared in advance for receiving MOR rewards.
