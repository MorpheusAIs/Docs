## Prepare to swap
Go to the Uniswap web app SWAP page [https://app.uniswap.org/swap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=arbitrum), search for and select tokens you wish to swap.

> [!NOTE]
> **In the example below we will buy MOR with wETH, but the process is the same for swaps in both directions.**
> 
> **You can NOT swap MOR until 12:00 UTC May 8th**

Click on **You pay** (token you want to sell) field drop-down menu and select wETH token (or another token you want to swap to MOR)

Perform the same actions with **You receive** (token you want to buy) field.  

You will not be able to find MOR token in the list, so we need to add it manually. 

For this, input MOR token smart contract address `0x092bAaDB7DEf4C3981454dD9c0A0D7FF07bCFc86` into the search field and click on **MOR** to add it.

If the warning message pops up, read it and click **I understand**. That is the standard warning for new tokens.

## How to swap tokens on Uniswap?
