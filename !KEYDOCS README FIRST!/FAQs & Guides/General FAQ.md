# Answers to Your Burning Questions: Morpheus FAQ

## [WHITEPAPER](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/WhitePaper.md) TL;DR
1) Access to AI has become fundamental to modern life.
   
2) Large centralized companies currently gatekeep access to AI, they actively restrict access & use censorship.
   
3) Having a personal AI that is open source, decentralized, and permissionless fixes this.
   
4) Morpheus provides users a decentralized, permissionless, personal AI.
   
5) Decentralized, permissionless financial rails is also required for true AI freedom.
    
6) Morpheus uses crypto-based financial rails to reward AI & Smart Agent providers.
    
7) Follow the white rabbit. Free your mind.

## [FAIR LAUNCH](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Morpheus%20Launch%20Phases.md)
1) There is no pre-mine, no token sale, no allocations, no VC investments, and no private sale.  
All earning of MOR rewards starts at the same time with the same conditions for everyone.

2) Launch date is February 8th 2024 for Capital Providers and Code Providers Smart Contracts.

3) Bootstrap period went for 90 days, MOR tokens are claimable started from May 8th.

4) Capital (stETH) can be deposited and withdrawn after a 7-day lockup period.

5) Only Capital and Code rewards go live in Frontier Phase.

6) Compute rewards start in Homestead (Q3).

7) Community (front end builders and smart agents) rewards start in Metropolis Phase (Q4)

## GENERAL QUESTIONS

### What is Morpheus?  
Morpheus is the Decentralized AI network and local inference with the purpose to incentivize network of Smart Agents.

### What is a Smart Agent?  
Smart Agent is a term to describe a general purpose AI that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user using LLM Transformer language that converts human language into actionable code for Web3 interactions using intent based abstractions.

### Who are the founders?  
There are no founders. The anonymous authors who called themselves Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo published [the paper](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/YellowPaper.md) on September 2nd, 2023, marking the beginning of Morpheus.

### Who is on the team?  
There is no formal team, company or foundation. Morpheus is fully decentralized and driven by a community of open source contributors.

### Is Morpheus Proof of Stake or Proof of Work chain?  
Neither of these. Morpheus is not a blockchain, but rather a chain agnostic set of smart contracts and decentralized software.

### Are there any plans for Morpheus to have its own chain in the future?  
At the moment, there are no such plans, but it's not ruled out in the future.

### Why did you choose Ethereum and Arbitrum for the launch?  
Ethereum has been chosen security and capital wise, while Arbitrum is the biggest L2 with cheap transaction costs which is vital for using MOR to pay for inference of AI models. It's important to keep in mind that Morpheus is chain agnostic by design and can be integrated with numerous chains and assets.

### How can I earn MOR?  
By becoming a contributor in one of four categories:
- Capital provider.
- Code provider.
- App builder.
- Compute provider.

### What is the purpose of each category of contributors?  
- Code providers contribute to Morpheus code base for ongoing development, upgrades and improvements.
- Compute providers provide the main resource for AI, which is computation.
- Builders of interfaces, tools and smart agents ensure utilization of network resources and produce innovative AI solutions for users.
- Capital providers generate liquidity streams for the ecosystem.

### Who can I contact regarding cooperation/marketing proposals?  
As the open source project, Morpheus doesn’t have a team or a person responsible for collaborations. You don't need anyone's permission to talk about Morpheus or add value as a Contributor. 

### What is MOR20?  
MOR20 is a smart contract standard projects can utilize for fair launches.  
Please visit the [MOR20 page](https://mor.org/MOR20) for more information.

### Is there a bug bounty program?  
There is. White hackers can get up to $150,000 as reward for eligible discoveries in proportion to the severity of the vulnerability.

### Are Morpheus contracts audited?
Yes, additionally to three tier initial audit process, any improvements or adjustments to the contracts undergo a cybersecurity audit.  
The list of audits is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/tree/main/Security%20Audit%20Reports).

### Where can I find a list of key Morpheus links?  
There is dedicated channel [#verified-links](https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1183934719155515463) in Discord.
