### How do code providers get rewarded?

Weight is the unit that represents contribution value. Weights concept explained [here.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md)

### How do I get in touch with other builders for collaborations?  
Discord server Accelerator Corner is your go to ⁠=> https://discord.gg/morpheusai

### Where can I see a task list?  
There is no task list available. Developers build what they want based on their experience and belief in its value for Morpheus. GitHub maintainers act as judges to merge contributors' work. Coders here compete, but there are no guarantees that anyone will use the code until it's released.

### Are there other ways to get involved?  
You can contribute by submitting a proposal as Morpheus Request for Comments (MRC). Explore the guidance [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC00.md)
