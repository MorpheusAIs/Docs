### What is the MOR maximum supply?

### Can I know more about tokenomics?  
Morpheus protocol rewards contributors with MOR token emissions. Emissions curve starts at 14,400 MOR per day on Feb 8th 2024 and decreases by 2.468994701 MOR each day until the rewards reaches 0 on day 5,833 (~16 years).  
The rewards are distributed as follows:
- 24% (3,456 MOR) for Capital Providers;
- 24% (3,456 MOR) for Code Providers;
- 24% (3,456 MOR) for Compute Providers;

### When will Morpheus be listed on centralized exchanges, like Binance?  
It’s best to ask the exchange representatives directly as they make the listing decisions.

### What is Protocol Owned Liquidity (PoL)?  
It's liquidity that is owned and controlled by the protocol itself, rather than by individual liquidity providers. This helps ensure the protocol's long-term sustainability and independence.

### How is the PoL created?
Morpheus utilizes half of the yield generated by Capital Providers to buy back MOR from the open market, combine it with the remaining wETH, and add it to the Protocol owned Liquidity.

### What is the utility of MOR?  
The main utility of the MOR token is access to the network compute resources for holders and rewards for ecosystem contributors. You will also be able to stake MOR towards frontends and smart agents you like, thereby directing community emissions to them and be rewarded in their native tokens. Additionally, MOR will be the main asset for AI projects launched in the Morpheus ecosystem, like ETH for Ethereum. Finally, all settlements between parties are also in MOR.
