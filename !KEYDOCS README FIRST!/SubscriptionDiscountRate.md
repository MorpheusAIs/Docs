# What is the "RSD" Metric? = ""Recurring Subscription Discount" %

## Description:
### This number represents the discount rate of providing stETH to Morpheus in order to earn 1 MOR, as compared to buying MOR on Uniswap.

### This is an important metric because the network effect desired is those that want to earn MOR and use it for its utility. So by providing stETH one can think of this as "subscribing" to the Morpheus protocol or platform in order to access Compute / AI Inference.

### Right now there is a significant discount to providing stETH vs buying MOR from Uniswap. This calculation is shown on Morlord as currently $14.55 USD worth of ETH yield earning 1 MOR. And the current Uniswap price is: $78.21 USD worth of ETH. So the current RSD rate is 81.73%

### As the amount of stETH has increased so has the effective price to earn 1 MOR. Also with the daily decay rate of MOR emitted the competition to earn MOR increases between those providing stETH.

## Context:
The purpose of the Morpheus is to build a community of contributors.
Best to attract people interesting in the real utility who want to acquire MOR at the best price compared to those seeking ETH on ETH returns (who are only sellers).

Its like BTC mining. It attracts people competing to earn BTC at the best price (or MOR in this case), which due to the decay rate and increasing competition tends to rise over time. 

Keep in mind Morpheus is a LONG term project. Builders, users, Contributors are what create long term value.

One used to be able to earn more for a few dollars, then it was $5, then $10 worth of yield, now its $14.55.
