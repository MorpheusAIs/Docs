# Defining a Morpheus Compute "Subnet"
- A Morpheus Compute Subnet is a specific Compute Provider who is offering "Inference" (LLM & Diffusion Models) to users of Morpheus. 
- A Subnet runs a Node on the network and utilizes the Morpheus / Lumerin Router to match with users requesting Inference. 
- MOR is required to Stake towards each Subnets for them to increase their "rank" with the Router and odds of getting matched to a user.
- MOR is rewarded to Subnets based on the "sessions" they do with users, the longer the sessions remain open the better their "reputation".
- Subnets may open the ability for MOR holders to Stake toward their Subnets and share the rewards (still under development).
- Morpheus is agnostic to where Subnets serve the Inference from, so users of Akash and other GPU networks are welcome to become providers.

## MOR Staking Requirement For Subnets To Earn MOR Emissions From The Protocol
- A certain level of minimum Staking of MOR will prevent bad actors from hurting the Morpheus Inference users with bad sessions & other attacks.
- This brings up the question of "how much economic alignment with Morpheus" is required to block most bad actors.
- An analysis of existing ETH Staking requirements of 32 ETH per validator would suggest around 6,400 MOR presuming 0.005 ETH per MOR.
- Though the risks around an ETH validator today are perhaps less than that of an earlier stage project such as Morpheus.
- With this in mind 10,000 MOR seems like an appropriate level to require. 
- With over 1,000,000 MOR claimed and "in circulation" that enables over 100+ potential Subnets.

**Clarifying Notes**
- This requirement should only apply to earning new MOR emissions from the protocol.
- Anyone is free to set a direct session with a Compute Provider and pay MOR directly.
- Also each Subnet operator will not be required to directly own 10,000 MOR, they can instead borrow it from users via Delegration.
- Subnets can Stake additional MOR beyond the minimum in order to increase their ranking in the Morpheus Router.
