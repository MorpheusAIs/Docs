# The 5 phases of Morpheus launch match those of Ethereum - Genesis, Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis & Serenity

## Genesis
**September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024**  
Morheus whitepaper released, first local install in October 2023. Following successful audits and testnet deployments, smart contracts for the Morpheus (MOR) token and its fair launch were deployed to Ethereum and Arbitrum mainnet on February 7th 2024. 

## Frontier
The fair launch commenced on February 8th 2024 kicking off the 90 day bootstrapping period.  
The Smart Contracts began allocating MOR token emissions for Code, Capital, Compute, and Community from day 1. Tokens become claimable and transferrable on day 91 of the bootstrapping period which is May 8th.

## Homestead
Rewards for Compute via Morpheus / Lumerin node go live.  
While rewards for Compute contributors began accruing on day 1, they will not be distributed until the Compute Router and other details are developed by the community.

## Metropolis
Launch of Smart Agents / End User Applications rewards via MOR staking.  
Similarly, rewards for Community (frontend) contributors began accruing on day 1, but will not be distributed until distribution details are developed by the community.

## Serenity
Morpheus spreads across many chains & yield types.  
As Morpheus is intended to be chain-agnostic, it is worth considering proposals to deploy the MOR token on other chains and provision yield (with eligibility for Capital rewards) from other sources.

- Examples of cross-chain deployments could entail using Wormhole or LayerZero to move MOR tokens between ETH, ARB, POLY, Solana, and the Cosmos chains.
- Examples of alternative yield sources could include BTC yield from Thorchain or mSOL from Solana.

These are significant and interrelated projects as adding yield sources necessitates adding the MOR token to other chains in a way where cross-chain messaging is possible.

### History
February 8th 2024 is the 28th Anniversary of "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" (February 8th 1996). 
Seems like a good day to release Decentralized AI into the world.
