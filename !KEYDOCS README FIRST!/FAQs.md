## GENERAL QUESTIONS

**What is Morpheus?**  
Morpheus is the Decentralized AI network and local inference with the purpose to incentivize network of Smart Agents.

**What is a Smart Agent?**  
Smart Agent is a term to describe a general purpose AI that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user using LLM Transformer language that converts human language into actionable code for Web3 interactions using intent based abstractions.

**Who are the founders?**  
There are no founders. The anonymous authors who called themselves Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo published [the paper](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/YellowPaper.md) on September 2nd, 2023, marking the beginning of Morpheus.

**Who is on the team?**  
There is no formal team, company or foundation. Morpheus is fully decentralized and driven by a community of open source contributors.

**Is Morpheus Proof of Stake or Proof of Work chain?**  
Neither of these. Morpheus is not a blockchain, but rather a chain agnostic set of smart contracts and decentralized software.

**Are there any plans for Morpheus to have its own chain in the future?**  
At the moment, there are no such plans, but it's not ruled out in the future.

**Why did you choose Ethereum and Arbitrum for the launch?**  
Ethereum security and capital wise. Pool of stETH was found to be greatest on Arbitrum as well as cheap transaction costs which is vital for using MOR to pay for inference of AI models. Morpheus is chain agnostic by design, there will be more chains and assets integrated later.

**How can I earn MOR?**  
By becoming a contributor in one of four categories:
- Capital provider.
- Code provider.
- Community app (interfaces and tools) builder.
- Compute provider.

**What is the purpose of each category of contributors?**  
- Code providers contribute to Morpheus code base for ongoing development, upgrades and improvements.
- Compute providers provide the main resource for AI, which is computation.
- Builders of interfaces, tools and smart agents ensure utilization of network resources and produce innovative AI solutions for users.
- Capital providers generate liquidity streams for the ecosystem.

**Who can I contact regarding cooperation/marketing proposals?**  
As the open source project, Morpheus doesn’t have a team or a person responsible for collaborations. You don't need anyone's permission to talk about Morpheus or add value as a Contributor. 

**What is MOR20?**  
MOR20 is a smart contract standard projects can utilize for fair launches.  
Please visit the [MOR20 page](https://mor.org/MOR20) for more information.

**Is there a bug bounty program?**  
There is. White hackers can get up to $150,000 as reward for eligible discoveries in proportion to the severity of the vulnerability.  
Learn more about [here.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Bug%20Bounty%20Program.md)

**Are Morpheus contracts audited?**  
Yes, all Morpheus’ contracts undergo three tier audit process:
- internal testing;
- specialized cybersecurity company [audits](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/tree/main/Security%20Audit%20Reports);
- bug bounty.

**Where can I find a list of key Morpheus links?**  
There is dedicated channel [#verified-links](https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1183934719155515463) in discord.

**Where can I get support and ask questions?**  
Community members would love to assist you in [#tech-support](https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1183666837460897832) discord channel.

## MOR TOKEN AND LIQUIDITY

**What is MOR?**  
MOR is the underlying utility token of the Morpheus network.

**What is the utility of MOR?**  
The main utility of the MOR token is access to the network compute resources for holders and rewards for ecosystem contributors. You will also be able to stake MOR towards frontends and smart agents you like, thereby directing community emissions to them and be rewarded in their native tokens. Additionally, MOR will be the main asset for AI projects launched in the Morpheus ecosystem, like ETH for Ethereum. Finally, all settlements between parties are also in MOR.

**Was there a presale, and what is the vesting schedule?**  
There was NO presale, premine or any type of token allocations as it’s a fair launch.

**What is a fair launch?**  
It's a method of launching the Morpheus project with equal conditions for all participants, without premine and allocations for the team, founders, investors, etc. MOR tokens can only be earned or purchased.

**What is the MOR total supply?**  
42,000,000 tokens that will be released over 16 years.

**Can I know more about tokenomics?**  
Emissions curve starts at 14,400 MOR per day and decreases by 2.468994701 MOR each day until the reward reaches 0 on day 5,833 (~16 years):
- 3,456 MOR per day for Capital Providers;
- 3,456 MOR per day for Code Providers;
- 3,456 MOR per day for Compute Providers;
- 3,456 MOR per day for Community Providers;
- 576 MOR per day for Protection Fund.

**How to buy MOR?**  
You can buy MOR on the Uniswap exchange on the Arbitrum chain after May 8th. 

**In which trading pair will liquidity be deployed?**  
It’s wETH/MOR.

**When will Morpheus be listed on centralized exchanges, like Binance?**  
It’s best to ask the exchange representatives directly as they make the listing decisions.

**How will token liquidity be created?**  
Morpheus will use half of the yield generated by Capital Providers to buy back MOR from the open market, combine it with the remaining wETH, and add it to the Protocol owned Liquidity.

**What is Protocol Owned Liquidity (PoL)?**  
It's liquidity that is owned and controlled by the protocol itself, rather than by individual liquidity providers. This helps ensure the protocol's long-term sustainability and independence.

## CAPITAL CONTRIBUTORS

**How can I become a capital provider?**  
You need to deposit stETH into the Morpheus contract.

**What is stETH?**  
stETH is a yield generating token that represents an Ethereum token that is staked in Lido.

**How do I get stETH?**  
stETH can either be minted directly through the Lido or bought on exchanges.

**How does Morpheus benefit from my deposit?**  
Protocol utilizes generated by stETH yield to create Protocol owned Liquidity.
Half of the yield is used to buy back MOR from the open market, combine it with the remaining wETH, and add it to the liquidity pool.

**If I stake my stETH, do I get it back, or is it converted into MOR?**  
It’s not converted into MOR, protocol takes only yield generated. You can get back the full amount of stETH you deposited after 7 days of the initial lockup.

**Do I bear the risk of impermanent loss?**  
No, there is no impermanent loss risk, you withdraw the same amount you deposited.

**Is there a minimum or maximum amount of stETH one can deposit?**  
The minimum deposit amount is 0.01 stETH and there is no maximum contribution limit. 

**Do I have to pay fees?**  
Yes, you do, since the claim transaction is generated on the Ethereum blockchain, and the MOR rewards will be received on the Arbitrum chain.

**How quickly will I receive my tokens?**  
After confirming the claim transaction, you will receive your tokens within a few minutes.

**Is deposited stETH locked?**  
It is not locked. You are free to withdraw any time after the 7 days initial lock-up period.

**Why is there a 7 day lock up period?**  
This measure was introduced in order to avoid people gaming the yield timing as protocol in fact rewards in advance from the moment you deposit, when yield is generated once a day.

**When does the staking for stETH end?**  
There is no cut off date. Emissions are a built-in feature of the protocol and will continue for at least 16 years of the first epoch.

**For how long should I deposit stETH?**  
It’s completely up to you. You can deposit for days, weeks, months or years. While your stETH deposited and contributes yield, it earns you MOR rewards.

**How do rewards distribute?**  
Daily emissions for Capital providers (~3400 MOR) are divided proportionally to your share in the total deposited stETH pool. For example, if your capital contribution equals to 1% of the total stETH pool, you’ll be getting 3400*0.01= 34 MOR daily.

**How can I claim my rewards?**  
You will need to visit the website https://dashboard.mor.org and click on the "Claim MOR" button, which will become active after 12:00 UTC on May 8th. 

**Are there any limitations for MOR reward claims, like token lock or vesting?**   
No, there are no limitations.

**Where can I check my MOR earnings?**  
You can see them at https://dashboard.mor.org/#/ when connecting your depositing wallet.

**How many MOR tokens can I get by depositing 1 stETH?**  
It is a dynamic value that depends on the ratio of your contribution to the total amount of deposited stETH. You can check it at https://morstats.info/staked_eth/

**Is there a minimum or maximum amount of MOR I can claim?**  
There are no limitations; you can claim any amount.

**How often can I claim MOR rewards?**  
The MOR token is accrued with every Ethereum block, meaning you can claim every 12 seconds, (after May 8th) but each time you make a “Claim” transaction will need to pay a fee.

**Do I lose earned MOR rewards if I decide to withdraw stETH?**  
No, you don’t, but you will not earn rewards any longer as you are not the Capital Provider anymore.

**Has the contract I deposit stETH into been audited?**  
Yes, both the community and a dedicated auditor have reviewed the Smart Contracts, see the reports on [GitHub.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/tree/main/Security%20Audit%20Reports)

**How will the stETH deposit contract is managed?**  
There are 4 of 7 multisig managed by community trusted open source contributors. 
The multisig address is [MOR.ETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1FE04BC15Cf2c5A2d41a0b3a96725596676eBa1E)

**What are the risks of providing capital?**  
There are always risks with smart contracts like bugs or vulnerabilities. To ensure a high level of security, the contracts have undergone multiple levels of audits, including community audit, cybersecurity company audit, as well as a public bug bounty campaign. Security reports are publicly available on GitHub. That's also why the Protection Fund 4% of emissions exists.

**Who should I contact if I encounter difficulties?**  
The community is always ready to provide support. Please describe your issue in the Discord [support channel](https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1183666837460897832)

## CODE PROVIDERS

**What do code providers do?**  
Code providers contribute to Morpheus code base for ongoing development, upgrades and improvements.

**How can I get involved with Morpheus as code provider?**  
An onboarding process is described in the [Coder Guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Coder%20Guide.md)

**What are the requirements to code contributors?**  
There are [Code Contributor Best Practices](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Contributor%20Best%20Practices.md) on GitHub.

**How do code providers get rewarded?**  
They get MOR emissions depending on their contributed weights vs the total amount of weights contributed.

**What are the weights?**  
Weight is the unit that represents contribution value. Weights concept explained [here.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md)

**Can I be paid in USD or stablecoins?**  
No, code providers are rewarded only in MOR.

**How do I get in touch with other builders for collaborations?**  
Discord server Accelerator Corner is your go to ⁠=> https://discord.gg/morpheusai

**Where can I see a task list?**  
There is no task list available. Developers build what they want based on their experience and belief in its value for Morpheus. GitHub maintainers act as judges to merge contributors' work. Coders here compete, but there are no guarantees that anyone will use the code until it's released.

**Are there other ways to get involved?**  
You can contribute by submitting a proposal as Morpheus Request for Comments (MRC). Explore the guidance [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/MRC00.md)

## COMPUTE AND NODE RUNNING

**What do compute providers do?**  
The main role of compute providers is to provide a vital AI resource for inference, which is computation.

**How can I get involved with Morpheus as a computer provider?**  
You can’t yet as Compute part is in active development with testnet planned for May and mainnet for June. 

**What are the requirements to compute providers?**  
There are no hard requirements set yet, except a whitelist in form of MOR stake at the initial stage of launch.

**How will code providers be rewarded?**  
Morpheus network pays compute providers only for compute actually provided through a competitive bid process.

**What are sources I can get more information on compute?**  
They are the [Yellowstone Compute Model](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Yellowstone%20Compute%20Model.md) and the [Morpheus Lumerin Model](https://github.com/antonbosss/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Morpheus%20Lumerin%20Model.md) that expands it.

**How do I provide compute?**  
Currently, there is no way to provide compute as the compute contracts are still under development, however you can still spin up and test the local inference of the node.

**Is running a node the same as providing compute?**  
Running a node is NOT the same as providing compute, compute provision is still being finalized so hold tight for more information.

**What is the Morpheus node?**  
Currently, Morpheus node is the local LLM with an integrated experimental version of Smart Agent. It will be evolving into the Node release by release, for people to be able to provide an inference to a MOR user.

**Is it the same node other blockchains have?**  
No, Morpheus node is not that type of node that runs blockchain and processes transactions. A good way of thinking about the node is as a gateway to the Morpheus ecosystem.

**Is there a guide on running a node?**  
Yes, please follow instructions [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/README.md)

**What are the minimum requirements to run the node?**  
To run the node effectively, ensure your PC meets the minimum requirements of 64GB storage, a GPU with 8GB vRAM, 32GB system RAM, and a CPU with 4 cores. These specifications will help avoid system issues and enable smooth operation, especially when running large language models (LLMs). 

**What are the minimum requirements to provide compute?**  
The recommended requirements will be announced after the tests, but in general, they will greatly depend on the models you plan to provide inferences for.

**Is running a node mandatory?**  
Running a node is not mandatory unless you wish to have your own Smart Agent settled locally. Users will still be able to use Smart Agents without running a node. While running a node isn't strictly required for Capital and Code providers, you will need one to provide Compute and Community apps.

**Are there rewards for running the Morpheus node?**  
There are no rewards for running a local inference at the moment, however, a full node will be rewarded when providing Morpheus Compute and Community functions.

**Can I run the node on Windows?**  
Yes, a guide located in the [readme](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.

**Can I run the node on VPS?**  
You can not run one at the moment as there is no version of the node that can operate without a GUI yet.

**Is there a platform through which I could provide compute?**  
None at the moment. However, work with Akash is underway to create a template to make this possible in a decentralized fashion.

**Will compute providers be able to use cloud infrastructure?**  
Morpheus is agnostic to how Compute Providers provide Inference Per Second. Akash, Bittensor, Ritual, EdgeLlama, whatever you want.

**I still have a question, where can I raise them?**  
The right place is [#compute-providers](https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1167520834139738289) channel in Discord.
