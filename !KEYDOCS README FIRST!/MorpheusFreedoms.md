# Morpheus Is Freedom & Liberty For All

Thanks to all those in the Morpheus community Staking, Computing, Building & Coding for Freedom. 

## The following 10 values embody the type of communities, projects & freedom tech Morpheus is built to protect.

- Open Source: The software code underpinning the Morpheus must be freely reviewable, editable & copyable by all.
- Peer to Peer: A system which allows for direct connection by all and is free of centralized intermediaries in all their functions.
- Public Blockchain: A distributed public immutable ledger / system of record for interactions of the Morpheus members. This can be used as proof that a Morpheus is following its own rules and offers a high level of transparency in the system.
- Tokenized Ownership: Setting forth the means of rewarding participants & stake holders in the Morpheus.
- Permissionless: No one should be required to ask an authority to use the public features of the Morpheus.
- Freedom of Access: No one should have their use of the application blocked or otherwise censored when using a Morpheus.
- Privacy Preserving: No one should have to expose their private information to use a Morpheus.
- Freedom of Choice / Exit: No one should be forced to continue running software or otherwise participate in a Morpheus if they choose to leave or join another Morpheus.
- Self Sovereign Identity: All users have the power to generate their own identities and their consent is required to use those credentials.
- Freedom of Association: Members of a Morpheus must be free to practice free association between themselves.
