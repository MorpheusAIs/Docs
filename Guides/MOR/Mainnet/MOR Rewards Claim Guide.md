## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the process of claiming MOR rewards on the Ethereum chain and obtaining them on the Arbitrum chain. The Metamask wallet is used as a reference in this guide, but the logic remains the same for other Web3 wallets.

## Smart Contract Addresses
**Ethereum:**  
Distribution contract: [**0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790)

**Arbitrum:**  
MOR Token: [**0x092baadb7def4c3981454dd9c0a0d7ff07bcfc86**](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x092baadb7def4c3981454dd9c0a0d7ff07bcfc86)

## How much MOR have I earned as rewards?
You need to go to the [Distribution](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790#readProxyContract) contract, open the **"Contract"** tab, then the **"Read as Proxy"** tab.  

Don't forget to connect your wallet by clicking on the **"Connect to Web3"** button.

The rewards are earned every block and to check the amount, you need to call the `2.getCurrentUserReward` function and input parameters:
- `poolId_ (uint256)`: pool identifier; enter `0` for capital providers pool or `1` for code providers pool;
- `user_ (address)`: user wallet address.
  
Click "**Query**"  

As a result, you will find out how many unclaimed rewards there are at the moment.  
Amount is in WEI and you can use this unit converter calculator https://eth-converter.com.

## How to claim rewards?
You need to go to the [Distribution](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790#writeProxyContract) contract, open the **"Contract"** tab, then the **"Write as Proxy"** tab.  

Don't forget to connect your wallet by clicking on the **"Connect to Web3"** button. Make sure your wallet has enough ETH to cover gas fees.

Find and call the `claim()` function and input the following parameters:
- `claim`: **0.001** - this is the amount of ETH that you will send with the transaction to pay for mint on the destination network. Any excess will be returned to you;
- `poolId_`: pool identifier; enter `0` for capital providers pool or `1` for code providers pool;
- `receiver_(address)`: Input the address that will receive the minted MOR tokens. 

> [!WARNING]  
> **Ensure the address is correct, as this action is irreversible.**

Click **"Write"** and confirm the transaction.

>[!NOTE]
> **After your Ethereum transaction is confirmed, it may take up to 15 minutes for MOR to appear in your wallet on the Arbitrum chain.**
>
> **This function claims the whole available balance, you can not claim in parts.**

## How to verify that I have received tokens?
Switch your wallet to the Arbitrum chain. If the Arbitrum chain is not added yet, use [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/?search=Arbitrum) and click **"Add to Metamask".**

Go to [MOR](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x092baadb7def4c3981454dd9c0a0d7ff07bcfc86#readContract) token contract. Open the **"Contract**" tab, then the **"Read Contract"** tab. 

It is necessary to call the function `6. balanceOf()` and specify in the `account (address)` field your wallet address. 

Click "**Query**"

As a result, you will find out how many MOR tokens are in the wallet, reflected in WEI.

## Add MOR to Metamask
