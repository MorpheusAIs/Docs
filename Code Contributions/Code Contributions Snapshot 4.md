## Code Provider - Proof of Contribution Table Snapshot April 8th to May 8th 2024

This table is for code contributions in Snapshot 4.  
[Snapshot 3](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Code%20Contributions/Code%20Contributions%20Snapshot%203.md)
[Snapshot 2](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Code%20Contributions/Code%20Contributions%20Snapshot%202.md)
[Snapshot 1](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Code%20Contributions/Code%20Contributions%20Snapshot%201.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Before adding a pull request to this table please read [The Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Contributor%20Best%20Practices.md)**
&
**[The Code Contributors Weights Guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md)**..

## Snapshot Timelines and Implied Value of a Weight
**Snapshot 1.** September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.025 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).   

**Snapshot 2.** February 8th to March 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.25 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).
  
**Snapshot 3.** March 8th to April 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $1.26 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).  

**Snapshot 4.** 
April 8th 2024 to May 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $*.** USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR). 

> [!NOTE]
> **Weights were rebased by 2,000 X at Snapshot 3 to create more granulatriy as fractions of weights are not supported in the Smart Contract. For more details check [MRC14](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/Accepted/MRC14.md)**

## Structuring your Code Contributions

All Code Contributions should include the following five elements:

1. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
2. Link to the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
3. Number of [weights](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md) requested (as a number â€“ do not include the word "weights").
4. Description of Contributions.

Example fields below:  

`|               Wallet Address               |     Link to Work    | Weights Requested (weights) | Description of Contribution |`  
`| 0x98eFf980C57c9D333340b3856481bF7B8698987c | Link to Commit #127 | 50                          | Integration of ollama       |`

Please include the "pipe" `|` symbol correctly as seen above so your contribution will format with the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.
