The weight calculation method explained [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#calculating-the-implied-value-of-weights).

## Structuring of Code Contributions

All Code Contributions to include the following elements:

1. Snapshot number.
2. Morpheus Referrence Implementation a contributios falls under. The MRIs list is [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Morpheus%20Reference%20Implementations%20(MRI).md)
3. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
4. Handle of a contributor GitHub.
5. Full description of a contribution.
6. Proof of the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
7. Amount of [weights](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#calculating-the-implied-value-of-weights) requested (as a number â€“ do not include the word "weights").
8. Weight Time. The number of snapshots for which the weights will be considered in emissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.
> - Only one MRI per entry.
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.

To achieve this, we forked, deployed, and verified the official Lumerin contracts, creating a 1:1 replica. This forked version was populated with on-chain data to register providers, models, bids, and open/close sessions. We revamped the UI and frontend to align with the official Morpheus design and developed a new backend to fetch on-chain data for models, providers, bids, and sessions. To optimize performance, we implemented a state-of-the-art caching mechanism that updates every few minutes, ensuring a smooth user experience. Key features added include: A graph tracking average daily IPS across all sessions, A marketplace table comparing models, best bids, number of providers, and active sessions, A comprehensive models page listing all available models and a graph comparing the number of sessions opened daily versus active sessions, Provider comparison tables showing total sessions completed, sessions for specific models, average IPS, and bid price per second. | https://nirmaan-morpheous-dashboard.pages.dev/, https://nirmaan-morpheous-dashboard.pages.dev/model, https://nirmaan-morpheous-dashboard.pages.dev/provider?address=0x23ECAd7A98CE5EC6cCaac8Bc01ae8d3bD07Dd7A6 | 35000 | 11 |
