The weight calculation method explained [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#calculating-the-implied-value-of-weights).

## Structuring of Code Contributions

All Code Contributions to include the following elements:

1. Snapshot number.
2. Morpheus Referrence Implementation a contributios falls under. The MRIs list is [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Morpheus%20Reference%20Implementations%20(MRI).md)
3. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
4. Handle of a contributor GitHub.
5. Full description of a contribution.
6. Proof of the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
7. Amount of [weights](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#calculating-the-implied-value-of-weights) requested (as a number â€“ do not include the word "weights").
8. Weight Time (in months). The number of snapshots for which the weights will be considered in emissions.
9. Stake Time (in months). The time of code contributor MOR rewards staking to get Power Factor multiplier. More details in [MRC38.](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC38.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.
> - Only one MRI per entry.
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 200 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.

The application features a simple, effective UI and follows a three-step process. First, users connect their wallets to load their accrued rewards. Second, they claim these rewards to an Arbitrum receiver address of their choice. In the final step, a timer and current balance are displayed, updating in real-time when the tokens arrive, and a confirmation card shows the updated balance and the amount of reward sent to the Arbitrum wallet. Additionally, the application includes a separate page where users can track their MOR token holdings on Arbitrum without needing to connect their wallets. This application is built directly on top of the distribution contract, ensuring direct interaction with the contract through our efficient and aesthetically pleasing UI. The streamlined claim process guarantees complete security while providing a seamless user experience. | [MOR Rewards Claim App](https://testing-2nm.pages.dev/) | 14000  | 11 | 0 |

| 7 | 2 | 0x915aB39de4bB670Bd2632E360075073de0c5c8B9 | ygarg25 | I have implemented a reward claim functionality within the swap_agent subfolder. This feature allows users to seamlessly claim their rewards by interacting with a user-friendly interface. The process begins by prompting the user to input the necessary details, including the Pool ID and the Receiver Address. Once these details are provided, the system prepares a claim transaction on behalf of the user. After preparing the transaction, the interface guides the user through the final steps, prompting them to confirm and execute the transaction to successfully claim their tokens. This streamlined process ensures that users can easily access and retrieve their rewards with minimal effort. | https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/moragents/pull/48 | 55000  | 11 | 0 |
