## Snapshot Timelines and Implied Value of a Weight
**Snapshot 1.** September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.025 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).   

**Snapshot 2.** February 8th to March 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.2 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).
  
**Snapshot 3.** March 8th to April 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.407 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).  

**Snapshot 4.** April 8th 2024 to May 8th 2024   
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.783 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).  

**Snapshot 5.** May 8th 2024 to June 8th 2024   

Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $1.186 USD per Weight (average price from the 8th to the 27th of May: $97.07 USD).  
The weight calculation method explained [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#year-1-weights-schedule).

## Structuring of Code Contributions

All Code Contributions to include the following elements:

1. Snapshot number.
2. Morpheus Referrence Implementation a contributios falls under.
3. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
4. Handle of a contributor GitHub.
5. Full description of a contribution.
6. Proof of the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
7. Amount of [weights](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#calculating-the-implied-value-of-weights) requested (as a number â€“ do not include the word "weights").

Example fields below:  

`Snapshot | MRI | Wallet Address | GitHub Handle | Description of Contribution | Proof of Contribution | Weights Requested`  

`5 | 3 |0xf93de9fb07f5762a1e3db9a5c687595111928d77 | mordeveloper | Integration of ollama | Link to Commit #127 | 1250`  

Please include the "pipe" `|` symbol correctly as seen above so your contribution will format with the table.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is new a new MRI column added where the contributor should specify which MRI the contribution is related to.
>  
> One MRI = one entry.
> 
> Don't combine multiple MRIs in a single line. Break out contributions into their own line in the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.
> - Only one MRI per entry.
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.
