## Snapshot Timelines and Implied Value of a Weight
**Snapshot 1.** September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.025 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).   

**Snapshot 2.** February 8th to March 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.2 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).
  
**Snapshot 3.** March 8th to April 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.407 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).  

**Snapshot 4.** April 8th 2024 to May 8th 2024   
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.783 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).  

**Snapshot 5.** May 8th 2024 to June 8th 2024   

Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $1.186 USD per Weight (average price from the 8th to the 27th of May: $97.07 USD).  
The weight calculation method explained [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#year-1-weights-schedule).

## Structuring of Code Contributions

All Code Contributions to include the following elements:

1. Snapshot number.
2. Morpheus Referrence Implementation a contributios falls under.
3. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
4. Handle of a contributor GitHub.
5. Full description of a contribution.
6. Proof of the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
7. Amount of [weights](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Providers/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md#calculating-the-implied-value-of-weights) requested (as a number â€“ do not include the word "weights").

Example fields below:  

`Snapshot | MRI | Wallet Address | GitHub Handle | Description of Contribution | Proof of Contribution | Weights Requested`  

`5 | 3 |0xf93de9fb07f5762a1e3db9a5c687595111928d77 | mordeveloper | Integration of ollama | Link to Commit #127 | 1250`  

Please include the "pipe" `|` symbol correctly as seen above so your contribution will format with the table.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is new a new MRI column added where the contributor should specify which MRI the contribution is related to.
>  
> One MRI = one entry.
> 
> Don't combine multiple MRIs in a single line. Break out contributions into their own line in the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.
> - Only one MRI per entry.
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> - You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.

Up-to-date UI & Frontend Development along with Up-to-date Backend Development using on-chain data from the Lumerin Testnet Node Smart Contracts. In-depth Documentation for both FE & BE also included as well as hosting, maintaining and updating the dashboard. We have reduced the weights as, Due to the pending major upgrade to the Session Contract, essential data for graphs, tables, and cards in the Marketplace UI (such as Total Sessions, Avg. Response Time, No. of Active Sessions, MOR Earned, Closeout Report, and IPS) is currently unavailable. To enhance the dashboard's visual appeal, we have used dummy data in the backend as placeholders. This approach allows for the seamless integration of actual data once the upgrade is complete, as the backend endpoints are already correctly formatted. Once the contracts are upgraded, we will rapidly integrate the data from these into the hosted dashboard and update the codebase. | https://morpheus-nirmaan.pages.dev/, https://morpheus-nirmaan.pages.dev/provider?address=0xE07F2b48FB5801F57FCFd6562fDA6185a66AF4C3, https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Morpheus-Lumerin-Node/pull/15 | 5000 |
