## Snapshot Timelines and Implied Value of a Weight
**Snapshot 1.** September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.025 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).  

**Snapshot 2.** February 8th to March 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.20 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR). 
 
**Snapshot 3.** March 8th to April 8th 2024  
Theoretical Implied Value of a Weight = $0.407 USD per Weight (price is unknown 1MOR = 1MOR).

> [!NOTE]
> **Weights were by 2,000 X at Snapshot 3 to create more granularity as fractions of weights are not supported in the Smart Contract. For more details check [MRC14](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IMPLEMENTED/MRC14.md)**


## Structurer of Code Contributions

All Code Contributions included the following five elements:

1. The Ethereum wallet address to be rewarded.
2. Link to the Code Contribution (this may be a commit or PR).
3. Number of [weights](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md) requested (as a number – do not include the word "weights").
4. Description of Contributions.


Example fields below:  

`|               Wallet Address               |     Link to Work    | Weights Requested (weights) | Description of Contribution |`
