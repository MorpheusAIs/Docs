# Code Contributor Guide To Earning Weights & Their Implied Value

## Tl;dr
The emissions for Code Contributors are calculated based on "weights". An individual's weights divided up the total number of weights times the daily MOR emissions. 
Morpheus is a marketplace for Code. Thus Coders are competing to provide high quality code at the best price, and then maintain that code and their weight in the Coder rewards.

## Calculating The Implied Value of Weights
Weights have an implied value due to the fact that they translate into MOR token emissions.
3,456 MOR every day (starting on Day 1) are rewarded across all the coders.
So a coder who has 200 weights out of the current 20,000 weights (1%). 
Then they would receive 1% of MOR emitted to Coders each day.
In other words they would be earning 34.56 MOR per day or 12,410 MOR over a year (a little less given the decay rate).

To calculate this into ETH or USD terms is harder, but as an example we know there will be 5,091,984 MOR at day 365.
If the total Morpheus market cap is $100,000,000 USD that would imply a per MOR price of $20 USD.
So our example developer who earned 12,410 MOR over the course of the 1st year, will have earned $248,200 USD worth of MOR.
In other words each weight in this example had an implied value of 248,200 dividend by 200 equals $1,241 per weight over the period of 1 year.

**So keep this in mind if you are bidding on Code work. 
If you are asking for 100 weights, you are saying the Code is worth $124,100 USD worth of MOR.**

## New Coding Weights
The Morpheus code is constantly growing and changing and so lets calculate an example of a new coder who Contributes their code.

Lets take for example the coding work being done on the Compute Proofs for the network. 
In this case their are coders bidding to design, impliment, and test the Yellowstone proposal's "Decentralized Router".
Say the winning bid is 1,000 weights to contribute the code.
Say there are 10 developers involved, who would each earn 100 weights. 

Given there are already almost 20,000 weights for existing Coders, this would constitute an additional 5% of the Coding weights.
The new total weights are 21,000 in total and the per weight payout in year 1 would be 0.16 MOR per day, per weight (3,456 divided by 21,000).
So in this example the Compute coding for 1,000 weights has an implied value of 164.57 MOR per day. 
Which equals 60,068 MOR over the first year (less with the decay rate).
Presuming the same $20 per MOR as in the example above that would value this Code contribution at $1,201,360 USD.
Over 10 developers that is a reward of $120,136 USD worth of MOR over the period of the 1st year.

This is really helpful to understand as it demonstrates the great value to Coders who provide their Contributions to the Morpheus network.
But also this high reward will generate a lot of competition among Coders 

## Market Driven Implied Value of Code Resets Monthly
Its important to understand that the implied value is decided by the market. The amount of stETH deposited creates a certain amount of yield that in turns buys up MOR from the AMM.
This Protocol Owned Liquidity increases the scarcity of MOR and provides liquidity for Coders, Compute Providers and Community FrontEnd developers.

The initial implied value of 1 weight was $50 USD before their was a market determined price as that is the average real cost paid to auditors & developers sponsored by Morpheus community members.
However now that there is a real world implied value of 1 weight this ought to be considered in each monthly snap shot.

While the exact price of MOR will not be known until May 8th when the Uniswap pool AMM goes live, the current implied price can be estimated based on the total stETH deposited.
At 88,000 stETH annually providing 2,904 stETH in yield balanced against the 1,222,076 MOR earned by all Capital Providers the first year. 
This at least right now implies a per MOR value of 0.00237 stETH per MOR based on real world contributions. Or $6.89 USD at the current 2,900 USD to stETH price on Feb. 21st 2024.

**All told this implies a current value of each weight at $400 USD.**
This is calculated by taking the number of MOR earned by all Coders the first year (1,222,076) and dividing by 21,000 which equals 58 MOR per weight. 
At $6.89 per MOR that equals $400 in USD terms.

## Weights Emissions Schedule & Supply Cap
The weights earned by Coders are only valuable if they are scarce. 
So to offer clarity on the estimate for the number of Coder weights that will exist lets presume there is a cap of 50 thousand weights the end of the Coder reward period (16 years).

## Yearly Coding Weights
- Year 1 / 25,000
- Year 2 / 12,500
- Year 3 / 6,250
- Year 4 / 3,125
- Year 5 / 1,563
- Year 6 /	781
- Year 7 /	391
- Year 8 /	195
- Year 9 /	98
- Year 10 /	49
- Year 11 /	24
- Year 12	/ 12
- Year 13 /	6
- Year 14 /	3
- Year 15 /	2
- Year 16 /	2
- **Total	50,000**

**Max weights that can be issued by end of year 16: 50,000 weights**

Again, this represents the MAX weights that can be earned in a period. Its the total buy signal in the Coding markeplace. Github maintainers of the 10 Morpheus Reference Implementations should seek to get contributions for something less than this maximum number. And keep in mind if anyone fails to maintain their Code weights WILL be earned by others or returned to the Coding weight reserve.
